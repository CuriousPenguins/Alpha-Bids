Users don\'t usually need to reset their forms, and they are more likely to accidentally hit the reset button than they are to actually want to wipe out their work. Unless you have a specific reason to expect that users will need a reset button it\'s probably best to leave it out. If you do choose to use have a reset button in your form, consider adding a check if the user actually wants to reset. You can do this by adding an onReset event handler to the &lt;FORM ...&gt; tag.
